            <p class="my-3"><span class="fw-bolder">Answer:</span> JavaScript is a single threat language. Uses an even loop to handle multitasking. Each browser has its own engine installed. Chrome browser has an engine called V8 installed and executes tasks there. And if it contains any asynchronous behavior it is supposed to transfer to the browser API. Callbacks from the browser's API are sent to the queue. The v8 engine tasks are sent to the v8 engine using an even loop in the asynchronous task in the callback queue(FIFO) after executing them sequentially. This helping hand is called an even loop.</p>
